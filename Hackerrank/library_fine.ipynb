    "Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).\n",
    "2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late).\n",
    "3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late).\n",
    "4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10,000 Hackos .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Charges are based only on the least precise measure of lateness. For example, whether a book is due January 1, 2017 or December 31, 2017, if it is returned January 1, 2018, that is a year late and the fine would be 10,000 Hackos.\n",
